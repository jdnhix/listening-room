# Symphony

Symphony is a web app that allows its users to democratize the music listening experience. Users can create a listening room that controls the music playing on their specific device and anyone who joins can search for and suggest songs to be played next. Everyone in the room can then vote on songs within the queue to determine the order of the music, giving everyone a voice in the listening experience.


# Background

The idea for Symphony came to me a couple years back. After attending many parties with subpar music and DJ's that seemed to ignore requests, I thought it would be cool if there was a way for everyone at a party to have a voice in what was being played. I developed an overall idea for Symphony with listening rooms and queue and since I was a big fan of the service, I decided to utilize Spotify's api on the back end. 


# Bugs
There are a few bugs in the app. However, almost all of them can be fixed by closing out the room and creating a new one. A list of known bugs is on the home page

# Future Steps
I'm looking to iron out the bugs listed on the home screen that mostly relate to creating the smoothest experience between concurrent users. The app currently lacks much design so that would also be a direction to improve upon. Finally, I'd like to add feature for password locked rooms and down vote limits that will auto delete songs at a certain negative vote count.
